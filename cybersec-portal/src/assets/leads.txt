Yes, if you want to add rows dynamically to your bulletin webpage as the data becomes available each day, you can use JavaScript to achieve this. Here's a general approach:

Retrieve the scraped data from your storage or database using FastAPI.

In your JavaScript code, make an asynchronous request to the FastAPI endpoint to fetch the data.

Once you receive the data, iterate over each article in the response.

For each article, dynamically create HTML elements to represent the row of information. You can use JavaScript's createElement method to create new HTML elements or leverage a front-end framework like React or Vue.js.

Populate the newly created HTML elements with the relevant information from the article, such as the headline, summary, date, and source.

Append the created row of information to the appropriate section or table in your bulletin webpage. You can use JavaScript's appendChild method to add the newly created elements to the DOM.

By following this approach, each time new data becomes available, your JavaScript code will fetch it from the FastAPI endpoint and dynamically add rows to your bulletin webpage, ensuring that the latest information is displayed to users.

Additionally, you can consider implementing mechanisms to update the existing rows if any changes or updates occur for previously displayed articles. This can be achieved by comparing the new data with the existing data and updating the corresponding HTML elements accordingly.

Remember to handle any error scenarios that may occur during the data retrieval or appending process to ensure a smooth user experience.
